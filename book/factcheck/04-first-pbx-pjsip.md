## Summary

- **Verified: 31** (rows reflect grouped multi-claim entries; all listed claims confirmed against an authoritative source)
- **Wrong (fixed): 1** — line 171: removed the false statement that PJSIP's `alwaysauthreject` "moves to the `[global]` section (default is already `yes`)". No such PJSIP option exists; replaced with the accurate built-in challenge behavior and `unidentified_request_count`/`unidentified_request_period` rate limiting (lab: `config show help res_pjsip global` / `... system`).
- **Unverified: 2**

## UNVERIFIED items the author should resolve

1. **DumpChan sample output (lines 587-621)** — The reproduced `DumpChan` output is 1st-edition `chan_sip` sample text (`SIP/4400-...`, `SIPCALLID`, `SIPUSERAGENT`). It is presented as illustrative and is already flagged by a 2nd-ed note recommending regeneration from a live PJSIP channel. The exact field values were not regenerated/verified against a live Asterisk 22 PJSIP channel in this lab (no registered endpoint available). Recommend regenerating before print.
2. **IAX `delayreject`/`delayrejects` option spelling (lines 268, 278)** — The prose calls the option `delayrejects` while the sample uses `delayreject`. The correct iax.conf option is `delayreject` (singular), but this could not be confirmed in the lab because chan_iax2 is loaded but not configured, and `config show help` for iax did not expose it in this environment. The prose/example are inconsistent; verify against iax.conf.sample and align both to `delayreject`.
